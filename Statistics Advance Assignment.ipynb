    "Q1. What is the Probability Density Function (PDF)?\n",
    "   - The Probability Density Function, or PDF, is a way to describe how likely different values are in a continuous         probability distribution. It shows the likelihood of a random variable taking on a particular value. In simple terms, it tells you the chance of getting a specific result in a continuous set of possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are the types of Probability Distribution?\n",
    "   - There are several types of probability distributions, but two common ones are:\n",
    "     1. Discrete Probability Distribution: This is for situations where the random variable can only take specific, distinct values (like rolling a die, where you can only get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n",
    "     2. Continuous Probability Distribution: This is for cases where the random variable can take any value within a range (like measuring people's heights, which can be any number within a range).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Python function to calculate the PDF of a normal distribution:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from scipy.stats import norm\n",
    "\n",
    "   def calculate_normal_pdf(mean, std_dev, x):\n",
    "       return norm.pdf(x, loc=mean, scale=std_dev)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Properties of Binomial distribution:\n",
    "   - The Binomial distribution is used for events with two possible outcomes (success or failure) and has the following properties:\n",
    "     1. Fixed number of trials (n).\n",
    "     2. Constant probability of success (p).\n",
    "     3. Independent trials.\n",
    "   Examples: \n",
    "   a. Flipping a coin (success = heads, failure = tails).\n",
    "   b. Pass/fail rates in a series of identical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Generate a random sample of size 1000 from a Binomial distribution:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import numpy as np\n",
    "   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "   sample = np.random.binomial(n=1, p=0.4, size=1000)\n",
    "   plt.hist(sample, bins=2, edgecolor='k')\n",
    "   plt.xlabel(\"Success (1) or Failure (0)\")\n",
    "   plt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\n",
    "   plt.show()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Python function to calculate the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of a Poisson distribution:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from scipy.stats import poisson\n",
    "\n",
    "   def calculate_poisson_cdf(mean, x):\n",
    "       return poisson.cdf(x, mu=mean)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Difference between Binomial and Poisson distributions:\n",
    "   - Binomial is used when there's a fixed number of trials and a constant probability of success, while Poisson is used when the number of events in a fixed interval of time or space is of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Generate a random sample from a Poisson distribution and calculate mean and variance:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   sample = np.random.poisson(lam=5, size=1000)\n",
    "   sample_mean = np.mean(sample)\n",
    "   sample_variance = np.var(sample)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Relationship between mean and variance in Binomial and Poisson distributions:\n",
    "   - In both Binomial and Poisson distributions, the mean (average) is equal to the variance (a measure of spread) when certain conditions are met. For Binomial, this happens when p (probability of success) is multiplied by n (number of trials), and for Poisson, it happens when the mean (Î») is equal to the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Least frequent data in a normal distribution:\n",
    "    - In a normal distribution, the least frequent data points are found in the tails of the distribution, far from the mean.       These are the extreme values that are much less likely to occur."
