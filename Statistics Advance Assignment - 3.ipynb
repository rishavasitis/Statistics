    "Q1: Estimation Statistics\n",
    "   - Estimation in statistics is the process of making educated guesses about population parameters (characteristics) based on sample data. There are two main types of estimates:\n",
    "     1. Point Estimate: This is a single value that you use to estimate the population parameter. For example, if you calculate the average (mean) of a sample to estimate the average income of a city.\n",
    "     2. Interval Estimate: This is a range of values that you use to estimate the population parameter. It provides a level of confidence about where the true parameter might lie. For instance, saying the average income of a city is between $40,000 and $50,000 with 95% confidence.\n",

    "Q3: Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "   - Hypothesis testing is a method used to make decisions based on sample data when trying to answer questions about populations. It is used to determine if an idea or hypothesis about a population is likely to be true or false. Hypothesis testing is essential in scientific research to draw conclusions and make informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Hypothesis about Average Weight\n",
    "   - Null Hypothesis (H0): The average weight of male college students is equal to or less than the average weight of female college students.\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: Null and Alternative Hypotheses\n",
    "   - The null hypothesis (H0) is a statement that there is no significant difference or effect. It represents the status quo or the absence of an effect. For example, in a drug trial, H0 might state that the drug has no effect.\n",
    "   - The alternative hypothesis (H1 or Ha) is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It suggests that there is a significant difference or effect. In the same drug trial, Ha might state that the drug does have an effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: Steps in Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "   - 1. Formulate a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (H1).\n",
    "   - 2. Collect sample data.\n",
    "   - 3. Perform a statistical test (e.g., t-test, z-test) to calculate a test statistic.\n",
    "   - 4. Calculate the p-value associated with the test statistic.\n",
    "   - 5. Compare the p-value to a chosen significance level (alpha).\n",
    "   - 6. If p-value is less than alpha, reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "   - 7. Draw conclusions and make decisions based on the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: P-Value in Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "   - The p-value is the probability of observing results as extreme as, or more extreme than, what was observed in the sample data if the null hypothesis is true. In hypothesis testing, a small p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests that the data provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to its rejection. A larger p-value indicates weaker evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to the failure to reject it.\n",

    "Q9: Generating Student's t-Distribution Plot\n",

    "   - The Student's t distribution is used when dealing with small sample sizes or when the population standard deviation is unknown. It is used in situations where the data doesn't quite follow a normal distribution, and it provides more reliable results for smaller samples. The t-distribution is especially important when conducting hypothesis tests on means.\n",
